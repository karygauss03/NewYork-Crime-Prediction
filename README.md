## Introduction
Contrary to the general belief that crimes happen at night or dark, offenses or crimes are related to more complex conditioning. By observing patterns and trends in the occurrence of such events, we were assigned to predict the probability and type of crime that might occure based on various features (i.e., location, month, etc.) in **New York City**.

Thus we present a simple web application to predict crime probability in New York City depending on user information, location and time.

## Dataset

This work relies on [NYPD Complaint Data Historic Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i). This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to 2019. The dataset contains 6901167 complaints and 35 columns including spatial and temporal information about crime occurrences along with their description and penal classification.

## Paper

To document our work, we wrote a research paper that is included in the [repo](https://github.com/karygauss03/NewYork-Crime-Prediction/blob/82c8ea1dc7fd75a5277862bb15b4f9d992d39985/docs/Crime_prediction_paper.pdf).
